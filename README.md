```

## Instalation for PHP <8
```
composer require muhammadnan/tripay-payment-gateway:1.0.5.1
```

## Configuration

before starting further, you must define or import a tripay for further configuration
```php
use Tripay\Main;
```

then after that configure api-key, private-key, merchant-code
```php
$main = new Main(
    'your-api-key',
    'your-private-key',
    'your-merchant-code',
    'sandbox' // fill for sandbox mode, leave blank if in production mode
);
```

or you can create or add env variable in your project (such as laravel, codeigniter) like this
```env
TRIPAY_API_KEY='your-api-key'
TRIPAY_PRIVATE_KEY='your-private-key'
TRIPAY_MERCHANT_CODE='your-merchant-code'
TRIPAY_MODE='sandbox' // fill for sandbox mode, leave blank if in production mode
```

and after add env variable in your project declare main class like this

```php
$main = new Main();
```

For mode by default it will be in production mode, to change it to sandbox mode, you can add a 'sandbox' after the merchant code

## Transaction
Before proceeding to the next step in transactions, please configure your reference merchant
```php 
$merchantRef = 'your-merchant-ref';//your merchant reference
$init = $main->initTransaction($merchantRef);
```
Before making a signature, please set the amount for close transactions and for open transactions, please set the payment method
```php
$init->setAmount(1000); // for close payment
$init->setMethod('BRIVAOP'); // for open payment
```

Note: if you use an open payment do not define the amount and vice versa if you use a close payment do not define the amount

## Create Signature
```php 
$signature = $init->createSignature();
```

## Close Transaction

To define close transaction, use the `closeTransaction ()` method

```php 
$transaction = $init->closeTransaction(); // define your transaction type, for close transaction use `closeTransaction()`
```

After you define a close transaction, please set the payload with the `setPayload (array $ data)` method

****examples:****
```php
$transaction->setPayload([
    'method'            => 'BRIVA', // IMPORTANT, dont fill by `getMethod()`!, for more code method you can check here https://tripay.co.id/developer
    'merchant_ref'      => $merchantRef,
    'amount'            => $init->getAmount(),
    'customer_name'     => 'Nama Pelanggan',
    'customer_email'    => 'emailpelanggan@domain.com',
    'customer_phone'    => '081234567890',
    'order_items'       => [
        [
            'sku'       => 'PRODUK1',
            'name'      => 'Nama Produk 1',
            'price'     => $init->getAmount(),
            'quantity'  => 1
        ]
    ],
    'callback_url'      => 'https://domainanda.com/callback',
    'return_url'        => 'https://domainanda.com/redirect',
    'expired_time'      => (time()+(24*60*60)), // 24 jam
    'signature'         => $init->createSignature()
]); // set your payload, with more examples https://tripay.co.id/developer
```

for get the payload u can use ```getPayload()``` method,

after set transaction u can sent the request and get data directly with the `` getData ()  `` method or for more method u can seen in the [request method](#request-available) or can be see in examples

### Get Close Detail Transaction

To see further transaction data, you can see it in transaction details, for close transactions, see below
where to get reference code? please go to the simulator menu and get it in the transaction menu, there is a reference code that can be matched here
```php 
$referenceCode = 'your-reference-code'; // fill by reference code
$detail = $transaction->getDetail($referenceCode); // return get detail your transaction with your reference code
```

the next method can be seen in the [request method](#request-available) or can be seen in examples

## Open Transaction

To define close transaction, use the `openTransaction ()` method

```php
$transaction = $init->openTransaction(); // define your transaction type, for close transaction use `openTransaction()`
```
After you define a open transaction, please set the payload with the `setPayload (array $ data)` method

****examples:****
```php
$transaction->setPayload([
    'method'            => $init->getMethod(),
    'merchant_ref'      => $merchantRef,
    'customer_name'     => 'Nama Pelanggan',
    'signature'         => $init->createSignature()
]); // set your payload, with more examples https://tripay.co.id/developer
```

for get the payload u can use ```getPayload()``` method,

after set transaction u can sent the request and get data directly with the `` getData ()  `` method or for more method u can seen in the [request method](#request-available) or can be see in examples

#### Get Open Detail Transaction

To see further transaction data, you can see it in transaction details, for close transactions, see below
where can i get uuid? please open the transaction menu then select open payment then there is a uuid code there

```php 
$uuidCode = 'your-uuid-code'; // fill by reference code

$detail = $transaction->getDetail($uuid); // return get detail your open transaction with your uuid code
```

the next method can be seen in the [request method](#request-available) or can be seen in examples

### Get Daftar Pembayaran Transaction
To see a list of payments made in open transactions you can use this method
you can get the uuid in your account.
```php 
$referenceCode = 'your-reference-code'; // fill by reference code

$detail = $transaction->getDetail($referenceCode); // return get detail your transaction with your reference code
```
the next method can be seen in the [request method](#request-available) or can be seen in examples

## Callback

Callback is a method of sending transaction notifications from the TriPay server to the user's server. When the payment from the customer is completed, the TriPay system will provide a notification containing transaction data which can then be further managed by the user's system.

please define the method below before starting

```php
$init = $main->initCallback(); // return callback
```

### Receive JSON

to get the json that was sent by tripay you can use the method below

```php 
$init->get(); // get all callback
```

### Decode JSON

rather than wasting time on json_decode, this package provides that

```php 
$init->getJson(); // get json callback
```

### Get The Signature

take signature from tripay using the method below

```php 
$init->signature(); // callback signature
```

### Callback Signature

tripay also sends a callback signature to validate customer data

```php 
$init->callbackSignature(); // callback signature
```

### Call Event

for re-validation, tripay sends an event in the form of `payment_status` this package also captures that

```php
$init->callEvent(); // callback event, return `payment_status`
```

### Validate Signature
To shorten the code, we prepared signature validation as well.

```php 
$init->validateSignature(); // return `true` is valid signature, `false` invalid signature
```

### Validate Event
To shorten the code too, we also set up validate events to go a step further

```php 
$init->validateEvent(); // return `true` is PAID, `false` meaning UNPAID,REFUND,etc OR call event undefined
```

## Testing

This package is tested using PHPunit, but mostly direct testing
